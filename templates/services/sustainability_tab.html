                                                            Replacement Program has taken a step towards the Green
                                                            Agenda program. This program will help to improve efficiency
                                                            of machines in industries.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>He mentioned that the low hanging measures which are easy to
                                                            implement, majority of industries have already taken efforts
                                                            and implemented such measures to save energy and emissions.
                                                            However, these efforts are not enough to mitigate climate
                                                            change risks and achieve energy security. He mentioned that
                                                            the green plants have capacity to reduce CO2 by absorbing it
                                                            but we can’t wait for it to improve environment by only
                                                            planting trees. We can adapt activities to change emissions
                                                            pattern and efficiency through such improvement programs. It
                                                            is not necessary to wait as it would be an opportunity lost
                                                            and hence time to take actions for sustainable
                                                            operations. </p>
                                                        <p>He said that technology is changing continuously for e.g.
                                                            computers changed from the large desktop computers to the
                                                            small handy laptops, mobile with keys to the smart phones,
                                                            bigger size TVs to the LCDs and so the motors have to change
                                                            from less-efficient to high-efficient motors. Transformation
                                                            is taking place and hencewe have to transfer from IE0/IE1 to
                                                            IE3 standards motors used in various applications. </p>
                                                        <p>He shared many of key insights from his experience.</p>

                                                            country but also the largest emitter of Greenhouse gases. He
                                                            briefed about his organization ISC (Institute for
                                                            Sustainable Communities) and mentioned that ISC is a non-

                                                            “Having
                                                            a sustainable approach is no more optional for the
                                                            companies
                                                            but is the need of the hour. There is a belief that
                                                            something like being sustainable is only for very large
                                                            organisations which is completely wrong. The reality is
                                                            that
                                                            90-95 percent of enterprises are not very big but
                                                            collectivelythey can make significant contribution in
                                                            various areas of business operations by embracing
                                                            sustainability. And they themselves are also impacted by
                                                            certain inherent risks. Hence sustainability is for all

                                                            sustainable approach does not necessarily mean
                                                            compromising
                                                            short term. He said that “having a sustainable approach
                                                            benefits in short term as well as in long term and lack
                                                            of
                                                            sustainability can reduce your enterprise’s value
