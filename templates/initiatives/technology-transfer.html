                <h4 style="line-height: 26px;">Supported by<br/>Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission,
                    Government of Maharashtra</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Technology Transfer</li>
                    <li>Innovation</li>
                    <li>I.P. Facilitation centre</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Hon. Prime Minister of India, recently launched the STARTUP initiative and the
                    mission to enhance the number of startups and Entrepreneurship. A major emphasis is
                    being placed on Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Startups. The entire initiative has a
                    definite orientation to Technology, Innovation and New Product Development.
                    Technology transfer is a process of transferring skills, knowledge, technologies, and
                    methods of manufacturing to ensure that the scientific and technological
                    developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can develop and exploit
                    the available technology into new products, processes, applications, materials or
                    services. There are number of well known institutions like the Institute of Chemical
                    Technology (ICT) earlier known as UDCT, Mumbai, National Chemical Laboratory
                    (NCL), Pune and such others. These institutes have not been utilized commercially to
                    the extent desired. Proactive efforts are needed in identifying suitable technologies,
                    packaging for delivery and identifying the end users such as MSMEs, potential start
                    ups, entrepreneurs who in turn will use this technology commercially for innovative
                    products and this will further foster Entrepreneurship.</p>

                <p>With this objective in mind, and also to efficiently support the Hon. Prime Minister's
                    initiative, MCCIA is setting up the first of its kind <strong>Innovation and Technology
                        Transfer Cell in Pune supported by the Rajiv Gandhi Science &amp; Technology
                        Commission</strong> to identify technology/processes that are ripe for commercial
                    exploitation and make it available to the end user. Along with this we are
                    establishing the Innovation promotion and IP facilitation cell also.</p>

                <p>This cell will get engaged in the preparation and making available Detailed Project
                    Reports (DPR). This will also benefit MSMEs, Startups by undertaking projects to
                    generate additional revenue.</p>
